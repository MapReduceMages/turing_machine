			A Turing machine is a <b>theoretical device</b> that can simulate any computer algorithm. It
			has an <b>infinite tape</b> divided into cells, each holding a symbol, and a read/write head
			that moves along the tape, reading and writing symbols based on <b>predefined rules</b> (instructions).

			A Turing machine operates based on <b>states</b> and <b>transitions</b>. At any time, it is in
			a specific state with the <b>read/write head</b> on a particular <b>tape cell</b>. Depending
			on the symbol read and the current state, it can <b>write</b> a new symbol,
			<b>change states</b>, and
			<b>move</b> the head left or right. This mechanism allows it to model any numerical computation
			or algorithm.
